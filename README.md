# Studying-Support
# Introduction

I know this should've been gui but I have no time and I think Studying Support is pretty good in command line too. It definetely does what it's told to. So I'm not going to bother myself with cross platform or gui. Actually, both would be possible if I just used C's special file managing functions and QT5 but as I said, time works against me. Well, if people request much more than I expect, I can write a proper cross platform gui application.  

# My Opinion on Studying-Support

Studying Support isn't really a huge gamebreaker for the user's exams. I strongly believe the biggest influence on someone's studying performance is his/her own perseverance against boredome or whatever is standing against this person's studying will. Nevertheless, my idea is that being tidy and planned while studying changes a lot and Studying Support's main aim is to maintain these.

To come to the system, as I mentioned in the introduction section, the program is platform specific and works on terminal. So it is not gui and impossible for windows users to run. Obviously, these are minus points for the program. 

The program is written in C. Even though, the code perpetually calls the system() function it works pretty fast and smooth. That's pretty positive. I also really like how the program is much more complicated than it looks. With that, it can be more complicated and it can get developed with new ideas. That's also positive points to me. Honestly, I don't think someone will try to improve a command line app but maybe when the gui comes out things will change.  

Finally, the game is tested on Ubuntu 20.04 and Linux Mint
